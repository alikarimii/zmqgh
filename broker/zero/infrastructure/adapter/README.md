There are two types of adapters.

1. **The primary adapters** use the **input ports** to **trigger the execution of use cases**.
   For example in a mobile application when a user clicks a button, relevant adapter should call the input adapter to request for the associated use case.
2. **The secondary adapters** are **called by the use cases**.
   For example a secondary adapter can be used by the use case to access a certain data from a database.
